In addition, the course addresses also object-oriented programming techniques. The course demonstrates the interrelation between hardware and software, and illustrates how the computers operates and how they can be programmed, with the emphasis on processor design and implementation. 

Topics discussed are Computer system overview, Measuring and comparing performance, ISA: instruction set architecture (MIPS, x86, 8051, JVM), Computer arithmetic, processor implementation, fast processor implementation, Memory hierarchy and caching, Interfacing, Modern architectures and organizations (superscalar, VLIW/IA64/Itanium), etc.",http://hdl.handle.net/123456789/80,kk,en,TU Delft,Computer Architecture and Organisation,DCMI::Dataset
